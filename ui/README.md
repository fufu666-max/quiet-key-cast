│                 │  AnonymousElection.sol
│   Blockchain    │  Sepolia Testnet / Local FHEVM
└─────────────────┘
```

### Smart Contract (AnonymousElection.sol)

The core contract implements a complete anonymous voting system:

**Core Functions:**
- `createElection()`: Deploy new elections with configurable parameters
- `vote()`: Accept encrypted votes with ZK proofs
- `finalizeElection()`: Request decryption from FHE oracle
- `decryptionCallback()`: Handle decrypted results from oracle

**Security Features:**
- Creating elections with 2-10 candidates
- Casting encrypted votes (each vote is a number representing the candidate)
- On-chain homomorphic addition of encrypted votes
- Admin finalization and decryption of results
- Prevention of double voting
- Election state validation and access control

### Vote Encoding & Cryptography

**Candidate Encoding:**
Candidates are encoded as sequential integers for efficient FHE operations:
- Candidate A = 1
- Candidate B = 2
- Candidate C = 3
- etc.

**FHE Operations:**
The smart contract performs homomorphic addition: `Σ(encrypted_vote_i)`
- Each vote remains encrypted on-chain
- Only the aggregated sum can be decrypted
- Individual votes are cryptographically protected

**Decryption Process:**
1. Election ends (time-based or admin-triggered)
2. Admin calls `finalizeElection()`
3. Contract requests decryption from FHE oracle
4. Oracle decrypts the sum and returns cleartext
5. Results are stored and made available

### Frontend Architecture

**State Management:**
- Redux store for wallet state synchronization
- React hooks for contract interactions
- Real-time updates via wagmi listeners

**UI Components:**
- Election creation dialog with validation
- Vote casting interface with encryption
- Results display with decryption status
- Wallet connection management

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is FHE and why is it important for elections?**
A: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first. In elections, this means votes can be tallied while remaining completely private - only the final result can be decrypted, ensuring voter anonymity.

**Q: How does this differ from traditional voting systems?**
A: Traditional systems often require trust in centralized authorities to maintain privacy. Our system uses cryptographic guarantees - votes are mathematically impossible to decrypt individually, providing provable privacy.

**Q: Can voters change their votes?**
A: No, each address can only vote once per election. This prevents double-voting while maintaining anonymity.

**Q: How are election results calculated?**
A: The system sums all encrypted votes homomorphically. The admin then decrypts only the final sum, which represents total votes per candidate.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What networks are supported?**
A: Currently supports local FHEVM development, Sepolia testnet, and can be deployed to any EVM-compatible network with FHE support.

**Q: What are the system requirements?**
A: Modern browser with Web3 wallet support. For development: Node.js 20+, npm, and Git.

**Q: How secure is the encryption?**
A: Uses Zama's battle-tested FHE implementation with zero-knowledge proofs for vote validity verification.

**Q: Can the admin see individual votes?**
A: No, only the aggregated sum can be decrypted. Individual votes remain cryptographically protected forever.

### Development Questions

**Q: How do I run tests locally?**
A: Use `npm run test` for contract tests and `npm run test:ui` for frontend tests.

**Q: Can I deploy to mainnet?**
A: Yes, but FHE on mainnet requires careful gas consideration and oracle availability.

**Q: How do I contribute to the project?**
A: Fork the repository, create a feature branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request. See Contributing Guidelines above.

**Q: What testing frameworks are used?**
A: Hardhat and Chai for smart contracts, Vitest and React Testing Library for frontend.

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Wallet Configuration

Update `ui/src/config/wagmi.ts` with your WalletConnect project ID:

```typescript
export const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: 'Anonymous Election',
  projectId: 'YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID', // Get from cloud.walletconnect.com
  chains: [mainnet, polygon, sepolia],
  ssr: false,
});
```

### Network Configuration

The contract is configured for Sepolia testnet by default. To use other networks, update:
- `hardhat.config.ts` for deployment networks
- `ui/src/config/wagmi.ts` for frontend networks

## 📚 Technology Stack

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity 0.8.24**
- **FHEVM by Zama** - Fully Homomorphic Encryption
- **Hardhat** - Development environment
- **Hardhat Deploy** - Deployment management

### Frontend
- **React 18**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite** - Build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **shadcn/ui** - UI components
- **RainbowKit** - Wallet connection
- **Wagmi** - Ethereum hooks
- **Zama Relayer SDK** - FHE encryption

## 🔍 How It Works

### Vote Encryption Flow

1. **User selects candidate** in the UI
2. **Local encryption**: Vote value (1, 2, 3...) encrypted using Zama FHE SDK
3. **Submit transaction**: Encrypted vote + proof sent to smart contract
4. **On-chain aggregation**: Contract performs homomorphic addition
5. **Admin decryption**: After election ends, admin decrypts the sum
6. **Result calculation**: Using sum and total voters, individual counts are derived

### Mathematical Example

For 2 candidates (A=1, B=2):
- Alice votes for A: Enc(1)
- Bob votes for B: Enc(2)
- Carol votes for A: Enc(1)

On-chain sum: Enc(1) + Enc(2) + Enc(1) = Enc(4)

After decryption: Sum = 4, Total voters = 3

Solving:
- a + b = 3 (total voters)
- 1×a + 2×b = 4 (sum)
- Result: a = 2, b = 1

Therefore: Candidate A got 2 votes, Candidate B got 1 vote.

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Solutions

### CORS-Related Console Errors

In **production builds**, you may see errors like this in the browser console:
```
ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE.NotSameOriginAfterDefaultedToSameOriginByCoep
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE.NotSameOriginAfterDefaultedToSameOriginByCoep
```

**These errors are normal and safe to ignore.** They occur because:

1. **FHEVM Security Requirements**: Production builds use strict Cross-Origin policies (`COOP/COEP`) required for WebAssembly SharedArrayBuffer support in FHEVM
2. **External Resources Blocked**: These policies prevent loading external resources like analytics scripts, wallet extensions, etc.
3. **Functionality Unaffected**: The core FHEVM encryption/decryption functionality works perfectly

**Solution**: In development, these policies are disabled to avoid console noise. In production, they are required for security but don't affect core functionality.

### Network Connection Issues

If you encounter connection issues with the FHEVM relayer:

1. **Check Network**: Ensure you're connected to the correct network (localhost or Sepolia)
2. **Restart Hardhat Node**: For localhost, restart the Hardhat node if FHEVM metadata is not loading
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache and reload the application
4. **Check Wallet Connection**: Ensure MetaMask or your wallet is properly connected
